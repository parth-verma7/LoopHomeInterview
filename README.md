Take home interview - Store Monitoring

## Problem statement

Loop monitors several restaurants in the US and needs to monitor if the store is online or not. All restaurants are supposed to be online during their business hours. Due to some unknown reasons, a store might go inactive for a few hours. Restaurant owners want to get a report of the how often this happened in the past.   

We want to build backend APIs that will help restaurant owners achieve this goal. 

We will provide the following data sources which contain all the data that is required to achieve this purpose.
